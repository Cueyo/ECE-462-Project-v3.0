											<h2>An Introduction to Measuring Heart Signals</h2>
										</header>
										<p>To introduce the topic and what exactly it pertains to it would be best to introduce the
											problem that this project was oriignally created to solve - Measuring Arrythmia.

											<p>Arrythmia itself is sort of overarching heart condition that pertains to the iregularity
											of the signals coming out of heart (ie: its beat). This measurment of those irregularities
											however, poses quite the problem in actual practice, as not only is it generally difficult
											to accurately measure a cardiac signal, but it's also as equally difficult to do so in a 
											reasonable amount of time.
										</p>
											Our project then, centers around two of the major solutions to that problem, as well as
											a simpler approach to finding Arrythmia and potentially a faster way of seeing the signals
											altogether.

										<h3>Fast Fourier Transform</h3>
										<p>The first and most commonly-used method of cardiac signal processing used in hospitals.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Short Time Fourier Transform</h3>
										<p>The faster and more mobile method used for cardiac signal processing (usually in the field).</p>

										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Arrythmia Detection</h3>
										<p>On top of these two parts of the project, we also plan on editing code that can detect heart diseases 
											such as arrythmia</p>
									</li>

										<h3>Faster Than Fast Fourier Transform </h3>
										<p>An experimental method that uses various algorithms and optimizations to be faster than the prior two -
											this one was not utilized in our project. </p>

								<p class="content"> Our project has gone through quite a few rewrites and 
									scope refocuses. This has come down to a variety of reasons, but perhaps most
									prominently, the recent COVID-19 outbreak; for this reason, we were actually 
									forced to rollback our scope (which originally covered the Faster-than-fast 
									Fourier transform as well) to only cover the FFT and STFT. Additonally, 
									other changes (such as a rollback on the arrytmia detector) have also occurred in 
									our plans, producing this roadmap as a result. </p>

									<h2>How our Project Progressed</h2>
									<p> As shown above in the Milestones tab, our project has progressed fairly well, 
										the problem however, at the time, had arisen in how we should've moved forward. 
										Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had lost the ability to obtain real cardiac signals, 
										what this forced us to do was use an online database obtained from the American Heart 
										Association, which contained various data for cardiac signals froma variety of people.<br />
										In additon, the major changes to the project came in the form of us retrofitting most of the 
									completed work to adhere to database signals, aming it so that some of the data had to be baked into 
								the code to obtain the results we wanted.</p>
